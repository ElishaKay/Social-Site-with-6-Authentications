Getting Started
---------------

The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:

```bash
# Get the latest snapshot
git clone https://github.com/ElishaKay/Social-Site-with-6-Authentications.git

# Change directory
cd myproject

# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

# Or, if you prefer to use `yarn` instead of `npm`
yarn install

# Then simply start your app
node app.js 

or:

nodemon app.js

```

**Note:** I highly recommend installing [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon).
It watches for any changes in your  node.js app and automatically restarts the
server. Once installed, instead of `node app.js` use `nodemon app.js`. It will
save you a lot of time in the long run, because you won't need to manually
restart the server each time you make a small change in code. To install, run
`sudo npm install -g nodemon`.


Obtaining API Keys
------------------

To use any of the included APIs or OAuth authentication methods, you will need
to obtain appropriate credentials: Client ID, Client Secret, API Key, or
Username & Password. You will need to go through each provider to generate new
credentials.

**Hackathon Starter 2.0 Update:** I have included dummy keys and passwords for
all API examples to get you up and running even faster. But don't forget to update
them with *your credentials* when you are ready to deploy an app.

**Note:** There is no preference how you name or structure your views.
You could place all your templates in a top-level `views` directory without
having a nested folder structure, if that makes things easier for you.
Just don't forget to update `extends ../layout`  and corresponding
`res.render()` paths in controllers.


Deployment
----------

Once you are ready to deploy your app, you will need to create an account with
a cloud platform to host it. These are not the only choices, but they are my top
picks. From my experience, **Heroku** is the easiest to get started with, it will
automatically restart your Node.js process when it crashes, zero-downtime
deployments and custom domain support on free accounts. Additionally, you can
create an account with **mLab** and then pick one of the *4* providers below.
Again, there are plenty of other choices and you are not limited to just the ones
listed below.

### 1-Step Deployment with Heroku

<img src="http://blog.exadel.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/heroku-Logo-1.jpg" width="200">
- Download and install [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)
- In terminal, run `heroku login` and enter your Heroku credentials
- From *your app* directory run `heroku create`
- Run `heroku addons:create mongolab`.  This will set up the mLab add-on and configure the `MONGOLAB_URI` environment variable in your Heroku app for you.
- Lastly, do `git push heroku master`.  Done!

**Note:** To install Heroku add-ons your account must be verified.

---

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/7KnCa5a.png" width="200">
- Open [mlab.com](https://mlab.com) website
- Click the yellow **Sign up** button
- Fill in your user information then hit **Create account**
- From the dashboard, click on **:zap:Create new** button
- Select **any** cloud provider (I usually go with AWS)
- Under *Plan* click on **Single-node (development)** tab and select **Sandbox** (it's free)
 - *Leave MongoDB version as is - `2.4.x`*
- Enter *Database name** for your web app
- Then click on **:zap:Create new MongoDB deployment** button
- Now, to access your database you need to create a DB user
- Click to the recently created database
- You should see the following message:
 - *A database user is required to connect to this database.* **Click here** *to create a new one.*
- Click the link and fill in **DB Username** and **DB Password** fields
- Finally, in `.env` instead of `mongodb://localhost:27017/test`, use the following URI with your credentials:
 - `db: 'mongodb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@ds027479.mongolab.com:27479/DATABASE_NAME'`

**Note:** As an alternative to mLab, there is also [Compose] but they charge after 30 days (https://www.compose.io/).

### How do I create a new page?
A more correct way to be to say "How do I create a new route". The main file `app.js` contains all the routes.
Each route has a callback function associated with it. Sometimes you will see 3 or more arguments
to routes. In cases like that, the first argument is still a URL string, while middle arguments
are what's called middleware. Think of middleware as a door. If this door prevents you from
continuing forward, you won't get to your callback function. One such example is a route that requires authentication.

```js
app.get('/account', passportConf.isAuthenticated, userController.getAccount);
```

It always goes from left to right. A user visits `/account` page. Then `isAuthenticated` middleware
checks if you are authenticated:

```js
exports.isAuthenticated = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
    return next();
  }
  res.redirect('/login');
};
```

If you are authenticated, you let this visitor pass through your "door" by calling `return next();`. It then proceeds to the
next middleware until it reaches the last argument, which is a callback function that typically renders a template on `GET` requests or redirects on `POST` requests. In this case, if you are authenticated, you will be redirected to *Account Management* page, otherwise you will be redirected to *Login* page.

```js
exports.getAccount = (req, res) => {
  res.render('account/profile', {
    title: 'Account Management'
  });
};
```

Express.js has `app.get`, `app.post`, `app.put`, `app.delete`, but for the most part you will only use the first two HTTP verbs, unless you are building a RESTful API.
If you just want to display a page, then use `GET`, if you are submitting a form, sending a file then use `POST`.

Here is a typical workflow for adding new routes to your application. Let's say we are building
a page that lists all books from database.

**Step 1.** Start by defining a route.
```js
app.get('/books', bookController.getBooks);
```

---

**Note:** As of Express 4.x you can define you routes like so:

```js
app.route('/books')
  .get(bookController.getBooks)
  .post(bookController.createBooks)
  .put(bookController.updateBooks)
  .delete(bookController.deleteBooks)
```

And here is how a route would look if it required an *authentication* and an *authorization* middleware:

```js
app.route('/api/twitter')
  .all(passportConf.isAuthenticated)
  .all(passportConf.isAuthorized)
  .get(apiController.getTwitter)
  .post(apiController.postTwitter)
```

Use whichever style that makes sense to you. Either one is acceptable. I really think that chaining HTTP verbs on
`app.route` is very clean and elegant approach, but on the other hand I can no longer see all my routes at a glance
when you have one route per line.

**Step 2.** Create a new schema and a model `Book.js` inside the *models* directory.
```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const bookSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String
});

const Book = mongoose.model('Book', bookSchema);
module.exports = Book;
```

**Step 3.** Create a new controller file called `book.js` inside the *controllers* directory.
```js
/**
 * GET /books
 * List all books.
 */
const Book = require('../models/Book.js');

exports.getBooks = (req, res) => {
  Book.find((err, docs) => {
    res.render('books', { books: docs });
  });
};
```

**Step 4.** Import that controller in `app.js`.
```js
const bookController = require('./controllers/book');
```

**Step 5.** Create `books.pug` template.
```jade
extends layout

block content
  .page-header
    h3 All Books

  ul
    for book in books
      li= book.name
```

That's it! I will say that you could have combined Step 1, 2, 3 as following:

```js
app.get('/books',(req, res) => {
  Book.find((err, docs) => {
    res.render('books', { books: docs });
  });
});
```

Sure, it's simpler, but as soon as you pass 1000 lines of code in `app.js` it becomes a little difficult to navigate the file.
I mean, the whole point of this boilerplate project was to separate concerns, so you could
work with your teammates without running into *MERGE CONFLICTS*. Imagine you have 4 developers
working on a single `app.js`, I promise you it won't be fun resolving merge conflicts all the time.
If you are the only developer then it's fine. But as I said, once it gets up to a certain LoC size, it becomes
difficult to maintain everything in a single file.
